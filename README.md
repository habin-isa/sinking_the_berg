This was a a floor to ceiling installation, the arduino and accompanied mechanics were mounted to the ceiling. The arduino controlled linear actuators that lowered a perspec tray into a tank of black oil. The tray had small holes in it, as it was lowered into the tank it filled with black oil, then once the actuators were retracted from above, the tray was raised, with black oil dripping out of the holes creating a small rain room.
